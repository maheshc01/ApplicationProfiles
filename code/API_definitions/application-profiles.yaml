    Application profiles allow developers to specify all relevant information about their application for both network and compute resource
    requirements,supporting CAMARA APIs and network decision making.

    This API enables defining, reading, and managing application requirements,including:
    - Network quality thresholds (latency, jitter, loss, throughput)
    - Compute resource thresholds (CPU, GPU, memory, storage)

    The information captured as part of application profiles can be used in different usecases for decision making. Please refer connectivity insights and session insights for more details as a reference to see how the information in application profiles is used for decision making.
    The scope will expand as new requirements from CAMARA APIs emerge.

    ## Errors

    If the authentication token is not valid, a `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` error is
    returned.

    Any more general service failures will result in an error in the `5xx`range
    with an explanation.
    ### Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive.
    Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error
    statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release
    associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses.
    The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API
    Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible
    error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how
    an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and
    Consent Management
    (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the
    released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the
    onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider,
    taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also
    being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local
    legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise
    their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of
    three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains
    in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of
    transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    PacketDelayBudget:

        The packet delay budget is the maximum allowable one-way latency
        between the customer's device and the gateway from the operator's
        network to other networks. By limiting the delay, the network
        can provide an acceptable level of performance for various services,
        such as voice calls, video streaming, and data. The end-to-end or
        round trip latency will be about two times this value plus the latency
        not controlled by the operator

    PacketErrorLossRate:

        For instance 3 would be an error loss rate of 10 to the power of -3
        (0.001)

        For 5G network the 3GPP specification TS 23.203 defines the packet
        error loss rate QCI attribute. It describes the Quality of Service
        (QoS) Class Identifier (QCI) parameters used to differentiate traffic
        classes in mobile networks, ensuring appropriate resource
        allocation and performance for various services.

        The packet error loss rate is one of the QCI attributes, providing
        information on the acceptable packet loss rate for a specific traffic
        class. This attribute helps maintain the desired performance level for
        services like voice calls, video streaming, or data transfers within
        the 3GPP mobile network.

    Jitter:
      description:
        The jitter requirement aims to limit the maximum variation in
        round-trip packet delay for the 99th percentile of traffic, following
        ITU Y.1540 standards. It considers only acknowledged packets in a
        session, which are packets that receive a confirmation of receipt from
        the recipient (e.g., using TCP). This requirement helps maintain
        consistent latency, essential for real-time applications such as VoIP,
        video calls, and gaming.
